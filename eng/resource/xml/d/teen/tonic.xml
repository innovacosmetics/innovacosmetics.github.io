	<icerik>SEBUM-CONTROL TONIC 
It balances sebum secretion and regulates skin's pH. It tightens pores and prepares
the skin for further treatment.
A tonic should newer be used alone as a cleanser but always together with a cleanser.
Morning and evening, after cleansing, apply with a cotton pad to face and neck. Do not rinse off.
Avoid getting the product into eyes.
